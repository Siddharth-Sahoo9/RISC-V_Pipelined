A 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor implemented in Verilog, supporting basic instructions and hazard handling.

**Features**
- Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback stages  
- Hazard detection and forwarding
- Simple and modular Verilog design

This project builds upon an open-source RISC-V core by MERL-DSU (Apache 2.0 Licensed), with substantial modifications.
